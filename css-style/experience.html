<center><p> Hi guys! How are you guys doing? I hope you are all fine. I want to share something with you all. Too many asked me about my previous diploma experience. So here, I am open to share my internship experience. Before this, I graduated in Diploma in Industry Management at Uitm Jasin, Melaka. Too many activities and knowledge about plants. A lot of work that my friends and I have to do there. They also taught us how to discipline ourselves while working especially working on the farm. In the farm, we have to take care of the trees just as we take care of our own family by giving them enough water, removing weeds and insects around the trees. Insects can damage and paralyze plants from surviving. Despite the days of having to work in hot conditions, we still enjoyed working together. What is important is group cooperation. Honestly, I miss going to the farm again. Actually, there is much more to tell but time constraints. See you again!</p>

<p> -Thank you for spending your time reading my page. I hope you enjoy my writing about experience- </p></center>
